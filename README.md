# TableauAnalysis_PublicTradedCompanies
The project analyzes five publicly traded companies, using Tableau for visual insights into stock splits. It suggests splits for Broadcom, Chipotle, and Costco to attract investors, advising against it for Apple and Tesla.

The project conducts a detailed analysis of five top publicly traded companies to evaluate their stock performance and make recommendations on stock splits. Using Tableau for advanced data visualization, the analysis identifies trends in stock prices and trading volumes, providing a clear basis for whether a stock split is advisable for each company. The aim is to enhance stock accessibility for investors, potentially attracting more interest without altering the company's market value. Through Tableau, the project offers actionable insights, particularly advising Broadcom Inc., Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., and Costco Wholesale Corporation to consider stock splits due to high prices and decreased trading volumes. Conversely, for Apple Inc. and Tesla Inc., where fluctuations do not significantly impact, a stock split is not recommended. This strategic use of Tableau analysis ensures a data-driven approach to optimizing investor engagement and stock market performance.
